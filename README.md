# Machine Learning App for MLDA Hackathon 2021

This app was created during the MLDA Hackathon in 2021. The application will receive video feed via the webcam, which will then be sent to the model on IBM Open Cloud. The model will return its prediction by displaying it on the screen.

Unfortunately, the frontend is unable to connect to the model.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. `yarn`;
2. `yarn dev`;

To view the project open `http://localhost:3000`.
